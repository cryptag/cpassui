# CPass UI

This is a desktop app made with electron and React.js that is designed as a simple UI wrapper for
the command-line utility cpass, which is provided by [CrypTag](https://github.com/elimisteve/cryptag).

If you're not using [CrypTag](https://github.com/elimisteve/cryptag) to manage your passwords, you
should be. Go install it. It's awesome.

## Installation and Running

``` $ npm install ```

then

``` $ npm start ```
