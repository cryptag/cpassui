# Deprecation Notice

This repo served as a quick 'n' dirty place to kick off development for a UI for CrypTag, but
this code is no longer actively being developed.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, see [CrypTask](https://github.com/elimisteve/cryptask).

# CPass UI

This is a desktop app made with electron and React.js that is designed as a simple UI wrapper for
the command-line utility cpass, which is provided by [CrypTag](https://github.com/elimisteve/cryptag).

If you're not using [CrypTag](https://github.com/elimisteve/cryptag) to manage your passwords, you
should be. Go install it. It's awesome.

## Installation and Running

``` $ npm install ```

then

``` $ npm start ```
